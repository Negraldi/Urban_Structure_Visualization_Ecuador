# Urban_Structure_Visualization_Ecuador
 This project involves the visualization of street data from OpenStreetMap for specified metropolitan areas. It involves the use of R libraries like 'lwgeom', 'sf', 'osmdata', and 'dplyr' to retrieve, process, and plot geographic features such as streets, islands, and water bodies. The resultant plots are saved in PNG format.
